# CSVtoJsonPy
Python programming to process a file and convert csv to json file 
Replace pick2.csv with your desire csv file name (the file should be in the same directory or you might have to include the whole relative path instead of just the name)
Replace pick2.txt with your desire text file name to be generated (just the file name will create file in the same )
